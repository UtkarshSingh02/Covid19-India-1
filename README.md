# Covd19-India
This is my attempt to understand the current situation of the pandemic by analysing the Covid-19 data for India
The data is collected from covid19india.org

The polynomial regression model as an R2 score of 0.97814 and the linear model as a score of 0.9625
Though the graphs show a decline in the pandemic, hope that the situation improves
